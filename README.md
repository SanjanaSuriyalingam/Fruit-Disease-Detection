Fruit Disease Detection


Overview :-
This project presents an intelligent system designed for the early detection and monitoring of diseases in fruits. Combining computer vision and machine learning, the system captures fruit images through a webcam, extracts essential color and texture features, and utilizes a pre-trained model to predict the presence of diseases. Upon detection, the system seamlessly communicates with an Arduino, triggering actions such as activating a relay for automation or alerting the user.


Key Features :-

Real-time Detection: Utilizing computer vision, the system provides real-time detection of diseases in fruits.

Machine Learning Model: A pre-trained machine learning model accurately classifies fruits as healthy or diseased based on extracted features.

Arduino Integration: The system interfaces with an Arduino for responsive and automated actions post-detection.

Scalability: The architecture is designed to be scalable, accommodating diverse fruits and diseases.


Usage :-

Image Capture: Use the webcam to capture images of fruits for analysis.

Feature Extraction: The system processes captured images to extract vital color and texture features.

Machine Learning Prediction: Leveraging a pre-trained model, the system predicts the presence of diseases.

Arduino Automation: In case of a positive detection, the system communicates with an Arduino, activating a relay for automation.

Dependencies :-

MATLAB: Required for image processing and machine learning tasks.

Arduino IDE: Necessary for programming the Arduino microcontroller.


Getting Started :-

Install Software: Ensure MATLAB and Arduino IDE are installed on your system.

Connect Devices: Properly connect the webcam and Arduino to your system.

Run the Script: Execute the MATLAB script for real-time fruit disease detection.
